# Overview
This project aims to leverage the power of Google Earth Engine to count the number of trees in a specified area or city using satellite images. The primary motivation behind this initiative is to contribute valuable data for environmental analysis, particularly in the context of pollution and air quality monitoring. By accurately assessing the tree count, we can derive insights into the overall green cover, aiding in the calculation of pollution levels and air quality indices.

## Key Features
Satellite Image Analysis: The project utilizes the capabilities of Google Earth Engine to analyze satellite images, employing advanced algorithms to identify and count trees within the defined geographical region.

Environmental Impact: By quantifying the number of trees, the project provides a foundation for assessing the environmental impact on a given area. This information can be instrumental in understanding the correlation between tree density and pollution levels.

Support for Tree Plantation Initiatives: The data generated by this project can be utilized to strategize and implement tree plantation initiatives. Understanding the current tree population can guide efforts to enhance green spaces and promote ecological balance.
